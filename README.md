## NPM

NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node.js.
There is no any full form of NPM

Here are some common NPM commands:

1.  `npm install`: Installs dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2.  `npm install <package-name>`: Installs a specific package locally.
3.  `npm install -g <package-name>`: Installs a package globally.
4.  `npm init`: Initializes a new `package.json` file for our project.
5.  `npm update`: Updates dependencies to their latest versions based on the version constraints specified in the `package.json` file.
6.  `npm uninstall <package-name>`: Uninstalls a specific package.

### `package.json`

It's a configuration file for the NPM.

### `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file is a file generated by npm (Node Package Manager) to provide version information for project dependencies. It helps ensure that the same versions of dependencies are installed on all machines and in different environments, improving consistency in project builds.

### Install React and React DOM

`npm install react react-dom`

### Install Parcel Bundler

`npm install --save-dev parcel` or `npm install -D parcel`
This command installs Parcel and adds it to the `devDependencies` section in our project's `package.json` file.

### Run Parcel to bundle and serve our project

`npm run start` or `npm start`

- **caret ‚Äú^‚Äù** : ^version ‚ÄúCompatible with version‚Äù will update us to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version
- **tilde ‚Äú~‚Äù** : ~version ‚ÄúApproximately equivalent to version‚Äù, will update us to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version.

### [browserslist](https://browserslist.dev/) in `package.json`

Browserslist is a configuration file that allows us to specify which browsers our project should support.
`{ "browserslist": [ "last 2 versions", "> 1%", "IE 11" ] }`

## [Bablel](https://babeljs.io/)

**Babel** package of parcel is a Javascript compiler which transpiles/compiles our code before reaching to JS

## [JSX (JavaScript XML)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

**JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files, making it easier to express the structure of our React components.

### [Functional Component in JSX](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

A functional component is a type of component that is defined as a JavaScript function.
or
A functional component is a javascript function that returns JSX.
We can also write any kind of javascript inside jsx HTML.

- We can also write any JavaScript code or a JavaScript function inside JSX by using **‚Äú{}‚Äù**.

## [Props](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- Passing a props to a component is just like passing a argument to a function.

## Config-driven UI

**"Config-driven UI"** in React refers to a design approach where the user interface of a React application is primarily defined and controlled by configuration objects rather than hard-coded components. This means that the structure, behavior, and appearance of UI elements are determined by configuration data rather than explicit code.

In a config-driven UI approach:

- Configuration Data
- Dynamic Rendering
- Flexibility and Customization

## üçîFood Delivery Appüì±

- Header

- - RestaurantCard
-      - Img
-      - Name of Res, Star Rating, cuisine, delery tie
- Footer

### Two types of Export/Import

- **Default Export/Import** (Can be used for only one)
export default Component;
import Component from "path";

- **Named Export/Import** (Can be one or more than one)
export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

### JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces
-  **Passing strings with quotes**

alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"

- **Using curly braces: A window into the JavaScript world**
  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  src={avatar}
  alt={description}

## Understanding UI as a Tree
![Alt Text](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fpreserving_state_dom_tree.png&w=1080&q=75)

## [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
**React Router DOM** is a popular routing library for React applications that allows you to create single-page applications with multiple views. It provides a way to manage the application's UI state and URL, enabling you to navigate between different parts of your application without reloading the page. React Router DOM uses a declarative approach to define routes using components, making it easy to create complex routing structures.

1.  **Declarative Routing:** Define routes using React components, making it easy to understand and manage routing logic.
    
2.  **Nested Routes:** Support for nested routes, allowing you to create complex UI structures with multiple levels of routing.
    
3.  **Route Matching:** Flexible route matching options, including exact matches, partial matches, and parameterized routes.
    
4.  **Navigation:** Programmatically navigate between routes using the `Link` component or the `useNavigate` hook.
    
5.  **Route Parameters:** Easily extract and use parameters from the URL in your components using the `useParams` hook.
    
6.  **Redirects:** Redirect users to a different route based on certain conditions using the `Redirect` component.
    
7.  **History Management:** Access and manipulate the browser's history stack using the `useHistory` hook.
    
8.  **Code Splitting:** Support for code splitting, allowing you to load only the necessary components for each route, improving performance.
    
9.  **Location State:** Store and access additional state information for each route using the location object.
    
10.  **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** Support for server-side rendering, enabling you to render your application on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client for improved performance and SEO.
