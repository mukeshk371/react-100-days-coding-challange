## NPM
NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for Node.js.
There is no any full form of NPM

Here are some common NPM commands:
1.  `npm install`: Installs dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2.  `npm install <package-name>`: Installs a specific package locally.
3.  `npm install -g <package-name>`: Installs a package globally.
4.  `npm init`: Initializes a new `package.json` file for our project.
5.  `npm update`: Updates dependencies to their latest versions based on the version constraints specified in the `package.json` file.
6.  `npm uninstall <package-name>`: Uninstalls a specific package.


### `package.json` 
It's a configuration file for the NPM.

###  `package-lock.json` 
The `package-lock.json` file is a file generated by npm (Node Package Manager) to provide version information for project dependencies. It helps ensure that the same versions of dependencies are installed on all machines and in different environments, improving consistency in project builds.

### Install React and React DOM
`npm install react react-dom`

### Install Parcel Bundler
`npm install --save-dev parcel` or `npm install -D parcel`
This command installs Parcel and adds it to the `devDependencies` section in our project's `package.json` file.

### Run Parcel to bundle and serve our project
`npm run start` or `npm start`

- **caret ^** : ^version “Compatible with version” will update us to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version
- **tilde ~** : ~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update us to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version.

### [browserslist](https://browserslist.dev/) in `package.json`
Browserslist is a configuration file that allows us to specify which browsers our project should support.
`{ "browserslist": [ "last 2 versions", "> 1%", "IE 11" ] }`

## [Bablel](https://babeljs.io/)
**Babel** package of parcel is a Javascript compiler which transpiles/compiles our code before reaching to JS

## [JSX (JavaScript XML)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
**JSX** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code in our JavaScript files, making it easier to express the structure of our React components.

### [Functional Component in JSX](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
A functional component is a type of component that is defined as a JavaScript function.
or
A functional component is a javascript function that returns JSX.
We can also write any kind of javascript inside jsx HTML.
